![Pride, Engineer of the Month, and Hackathon Pins](https://github.com/chrsjxn/chrsjxn/blob/master/DSC00701-HDR.jpg)

## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I am...
- Chris (He/Him)
- a senior web engineer (JS/TS, React, Node, ...)
- a much less senior dev ops engineer (k8s, Jenkins, AWS, ...)
- a champion for inclusive, welcoming, and respectful team culture
- still feeling a little weird that my coworkers have buttons with my face on them
