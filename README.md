![Pride, Engineer of the Month, and Hackathon Pins](https://github.com/chrsjxn/chrsjxn/blob/master/DSC00701-HDR.jpg)

## Hi there! 👋 I am...
- Chris (He/Him)
- a senior web engineer (JS/TS, React, Node, ...)
- a much less senior dev ops engineer (k8s, Jenkins, AWS, ...)
- a champion for inclusive, welcoming, and respectful team culture
- still grateful that my work in mentorship, team building, and code review was celebrated by my peers!
  - Even if it means many people now own a pin with my face on it...
